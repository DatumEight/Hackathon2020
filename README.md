# 'Women in Tech' Hackathon - Team 3

Hackathon - Friday, 6th March 2020

The goal of this Hackathon is to work together as a team in the same way you would work on projects in a production environment with your future coworkers.

## Live Demo
See the live demo [here:](https://datumeight.github.io/Hackathon2020/)

## Project Overview

**THEME**
### International Women’s Day - Women in Tech

**CHALLENGE**
"Your challenge is to create a fun and engaging website designed to educate children about the life and/or work of your team’s assigned woman in tech. This isn’t just another wikipedia page - this is about getting kids excited and engaged about the amazing contributions that these women have made to the tech world. So think about your audience and make your project as engaging and innovative as possible!"

### OUR TEAM’S FAMOUS ‘WOMAN IN TECH’: __Ada Lovelace__

Ada Lovelace - “The Enchantress of Numbers”
Augusta Ada King, Countess of Lovelace was an English mathematician and writer, chiefly known for her work on Charles Babbage’s proposed mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine.

## Project Requirements

Create a simple and engaging site for young people who want to learn about Ada Lovelace and her contribution to tech

Key words for requirement/use cases: “Educate Children”, “Life and/ or work” (RMC- probably a bit of both I think), “Getting kids excited”, “Amazing contributions”, ” engaging and innovative”

Use Cases
* As a student, I want to see ada’s work accomplishments and general research
* As a student,  I want to know about her life and why she is a celebrated woman in tech
* As a student,  I want to know about Ada’s role within the Analytical Engine’s development - how important was she to the team?  What were her main contributions?  Why are these so important?
* As a student,  I want to know what obstacles Ada might have had to overcome and why she was inspired to do so.
* As a teacher, I'd like an intuitive and easy to understand background of who ada is and the work she contributed to computing.

## UX
Strategy 
- Site Objectives
Educational
Engaging for children
Foster excitement in Tech as a career path for women
User Needs
(see Use Cases above)

Scope
- Content
Image Carousel (Bootstrap)
Embedded Youtube Videos
Embedded Google map showing birthplace
External links to next steps kids can take to pursue their interest
Section on legacy and lasting contribution to Computing

Structure 
- Interaction Design
Feedback very important to keep kids engaged ie colour changes on hover of buttons, image carousels
-Information Architecture
Single page to retain user engagement

Skeleton
 - Sections for Introduction, Early Life, Ada's Work, 'Learn Like Ada'
 - 'Learn like Ada' represents a progression from one idea to the next, so separate sections for each
 - Blurbs which describe why the user might want to learn to code, and how to start
 - Resources section

Surface
Colours & Fonts
Bright/Playful
Easy to navigate
