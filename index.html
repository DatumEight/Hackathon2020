					<!--Timeline of Ada's Early Life-->
					<h3 class="section-heading">Childhood</h3>
					<p>Ada Byron was born Ada Byron on the 10 December 1815. She was the only child of Lord and Lady
						Byron.</p>
					<p>As a child she was often ill. This however, did not stop here developing her mathematical
						and technological skills. Ada had a fascination with machines– designing fanciful boats and
						steam flying machines, and poring over the diagrams of the new inventions of the Industrial
						Revolution that filled the scientific magazines of the time</p>
					<p>At the age of 19 she was married to an aristocrat, William King; when King was made Earl of
						Lovelace in 1838 his wife became Lady Ada King, Countess of Lovelace. She thereafter she was
						know as Ada Lovelace</p>

					<h3 class="section-heading">Education</h3>
					<p>
						Ada was privately schooled in mathematics and science by noted 19th-century researcher and
						scientific authors.
					</p>
					<p>
						In 1833, Lovelace’s mentor, the scientist and polymath Mary Sommerville, introduced her to
						Charles Babbage, the Lucasian Professor of Mathematics who had already attained considerable
						celebrity for his visionary and perpetually unfinished plans for gigantic clockwork
						calculating machines. Charles Babbage and Ada Lovelace both had somewhat unconventional
						personalities and became close and lifelong friends. Babbage described her as “that
						Enchantress who has thrown her magical spell around the most abstract of Sciences and has
						grasped it with a force which few masculine intellects could have exerted over it,” or an
						another occasion, as “The Enchantress of Numbers”.
					</p>

					<h3 class="section-heading">Difference Engine</h3>
					<p>
						In 1842 Lovelace translated a short article describing the Analytical Engine by the italian
						mathematician Luigi Menabrea, for publication in England. Babbage asked her to expand the
						article, “as she understood the machine so well”. The final article is over three times the
						length of the original and contains several early ‘computer programs,’ as well as strikingly
						prescient observations on the potential uses of the machine, including the manipulation of
						symbols and creation of music. Although Babbage and his assistants had sketched out programs
						for his engine before, Lovelace’s are the most elaborate and complete, and the first to be
						published; so she is often referred to as “the first computer programmer”. Babbage himself
						“spoke highly of her mathematical powers, and of her peculiar capability — higher he said
						than of any one he knew, to prepare the descriptions connected with his calculating machine.
					</p>
					<h3 class="section-heading">Death</h3>
					<p>
						Sadly Ada Lovelace died of cancer at 36, a few short years after the publication of “Sketch of
						the
						Analytical Engine, with Notes from the Translator”.
